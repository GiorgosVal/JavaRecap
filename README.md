# JavaRecap
This repo contains mini-projects that are usefull for a Java recap. It will be updated periodically and according to my progress in this subject.

## Contents
### EqualsVsEquals
#### Study about the equality of Strings and Objects.
Creating Strings using the assignment way and constructor way, and also ```StringBuilder``` and ```StringBuffer```.
Creating Objects by/without overriding ```equals()``` or ```hashCode```.
Comparing strings and objects using ```equals()``` and ```==``` operator.

### Factorial
Calculating the factorial of a number using simple loop, Stream and recursive methods. Use of BigInteger for big values.

### PassByValue
Showcasing the meaning of the term.

### PrimeNumbers
Comparing three different algorithms for finding if a number is prime. Comparing them by using the [MethodTimer](https://github.com/GiorgosVal/MethodTimer) functional interface. Also implementation of two extra methods, one for finding the closest prime numbers of a given number, and one for finding the prime numbers within a given range.

### StackOverflowVsOutOfMemory
A simple example showcasing the cases that may result in a ```java.lang.StackOverflowError``` or an ```java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space```.
Explaining the differences between these two errors.
Lastly, reference is made to the configuration flags ```-Xss```, ```-Xmx``` and ```-Xms``` and their usage.

### ThreadAndRunnable
A simple example about creating multiple threads using the Thread class and Runnable functional interface.
